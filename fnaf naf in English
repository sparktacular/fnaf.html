<p>Five Nights at Freddy's, abbreviated as FNaF, is an indie horror video game developed by Scott Braden Cawthon. The game was first released on August 18, 2014.</p>
<p>Since its release, Five Nights at Freddy's has 9 main parts of the game, several books, and a movie. </p> 

<p>A short recap of the lore: You are a security guard on the night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where you notice that the robots' behavior has become quite unusual and unpredictable for a pile of old metal. From your office, you must keep a close eye on the security cameras. </p>

<p>FNAF gameplay focuses on resource management, such as electricity, which is limited. The player must monitor the animatronics using cameras and make decisions about when to close doors or turn on lights to avoid attack. The game creates a tense atmosphere through sound effects, unexpected appearances of animatronics, and limited resources. The first three parts of the game have exactly this gameplay, and then it gradually changes. As does the main character. Between some parts of the game, there are canonical additions and mini-games that completely deviate from the main storyline.</p>

<p>One of the main highlights of the game is the intricate plot, which is based on a timeline that does not match the sequence of the games' releases. It has not yet been fully unraveled. At the center of the story is a mysterious and dark story about missing children, animatronics, and their connection with the Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant. To a large extent, the plot is reflected in the mini-games built into the game. They are the most informative part of the game, up until part 9 and its additions. Also, plot twists with the release of each new part only further confuse players and destroy the foundation of the plot built brick by brick.</p>
